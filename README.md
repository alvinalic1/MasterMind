# MasterMind
Mastermind game where the player can choose if they want to be the creator of the secret code or the guesser
Whoever is guessing has 12 guesses to get the correct answer

If the computer is guessing then worst case it will take 8 guesses and best case will take 4
The aglorithm makes the computer guess one color at a time for all of the guesses and whenever it gets a green hint it saves that

If the computer is generating the code, no duplicates are allowed so each color is unique

If the person is generating the code, you can add as many duplicates as you want, worste case will remain the same for the computer
